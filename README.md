# Macro-Recorder

ABOUT

An AutoHotKey script that can record macros on the fly. It can do most keys and and all mouse functions. It cannot do modifier keys like shift, control, alt, etc at this time.
It does not permanently record the macro to a file. Its just a temporary copy ment for disposable macros.

HOW TO USE

Install Autohotkey if you don't already have it installed. Download and run this script.

Hit F4 to start or stop recording. Hit F8 to start or stop playback. This will loop the recording forever.
F9 will play back one time, and F10 will play back 10 times. These can be queued; F10 3 times in a row will play back 30 loops and then stop.

If something goes wrong you can hit windows+r to reset the program, and windows+q to quit the program.
